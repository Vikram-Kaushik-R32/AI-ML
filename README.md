## Demo AI/ML Project

**This repository showcases a basic implementation of [ML task, e.g., image classification, text generation].**

### Getting Started
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/demo-project.git
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. **Prepare data:**
   * Download and preprocess your data according to the instructions in `data/README.md`.
4. **Train the model:**
   ```bash
   python train.py
   ```
5. **Make predictions:**
   ```bash
   python predict.py
   ```

### Project Structure
* `data`: Contains raw and preprocessed data.
* `src`: Python source code for model training and prediction.
* `models`: Stores trained model artifacts.
* `notebooks`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.

### Contributing
Feel free to fork the repository and contribute improvements!

**Note:** This is a basic example. You should tailor the README to your specific project, including details about the dataset, model architecture, hyperparameters, and evaluation metrics.
